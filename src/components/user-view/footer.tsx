We urge you to donate only to verified organizations, as they have undergone a thorough verification process to ensure that your contributions are reaching the right hands. Please remember, donations are vital for the success of the causes we support, and we are committed to providing a safe and transparent environment for you to contribute. So far, we have worked hard to establish a robust verification system for organizations, allowing them to provide necessary details, including account information for offline donations, while ensuring that their status is updated upon verification. Our platform also enables users to view, like, and comment on posts created by registered organizations. We are continually improving to make your experience seamless and impactful. We thank you for your generosity and encourage you to be part of this meaningful journey"
